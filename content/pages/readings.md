What is Searle's analysis of social construction? On his view, what sorts of things are socially constructed? Is there a way to make sense of the claim that gender or race is socially constructed on his view?

How does Mallon's account differ from Searle's? How would Mallon's account handle the (purported) social construction of gender and/or race?

{{< tdopen >}}


Hacking suggests that we must distinguish the social construction of ideas and of things. How are each constructed? Are there different senses of social construction that apply to each?

On Hacking’s view, what things are socially constructed? In saying that something is socially constructed, is one committed to saying that social factors brought it into existence?  What is one saying?

On Hacking's view, are kinds of things socially constructed? Is this idea-construction or thing-construction?

Are there some forms of social construction that Hacking's view doesn't accommodate?

Why might one think that the aim of social science is to provide a critical theory?

Do the ordinary norms of science, e.g., objectivity, empirical adequacy, predictive power, apply to critical theories?
